### Readme: unp-inplace (shell script)
### Warning! ###
I'm new to bash scripting, so watch out for bugs. Also, I haven't used 
unp on very many types of archives, so I don't know its syntax in and 
out. I think (hope) I've covered the basic functionality enough to make 
this usable.

### About ###
unp-inplace is a tiny little wrapper around unp. Just like unp, it lets 
you unpack nearly any archive, without having to remember countless 
shell commands and flags.

The twist is that it uses unp to unpack things where /they/ are, 
not where /you/ are in your shell. Just pass it one or more archives, 
and it'll tell unp to work its magic on each one, right from inside the 
archive's parent directory.

The end result is that no matter where you run unp-inplace from, you'll 
end up with ARCHIVE/ in the same place as ARCHIVE.gz, just where one 
might expect it to go (if one were converting from a mac, as I am.)

### Installing ###
You can install or remove unp-inplace using the provided install.sh 
script. Because it depends on unp (which isn't included), you'll need
to install that on your own.

### Usage ###
unp-inplace [archive.gz] [somewhere/else/another.zip]
(or, just run it without arguments to get the short info/usage text.)

### .desktop ###
I've also included a .desktop file, which /should/ allow you to 
associate the script with mime-types in nautilus (so that selecting 
and opening archive(s) runs unp-inplace on them in a shell). 
I've yet to test this very much, but it seems to work on Debian/Gnome2.
(Though not on Arch/Gnome3, for a reason as yet unknown.)
